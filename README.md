## Problem Description

This problem is a classical Coding Dojo: [Tennis Coding Dojo](https://codingdojo.org/kata/Tennis/).
The objective is to implement a scoring system for a simplified version of tennis.

The scoring system is rather simple:

1. Each player can have either of these points in one game: `love`, `15`, `30`, `40`.
2. If you have `40` and you win the point you win the game, however there are special rules.
3. If both have `40` the players are _deuce_.
4. If the game is in _deuce_, the winner of a point will have _advantage_
5. If the player with _advantage_ wins the ball they win the game
6. If the player without _advantage_ wins they are back at deuce.

### Assumptions

The problem description is vague and imprecise, and does not indicate how the score is actually 
incremented. We'll operate under the following assumptions:

- Players are characterized by a _strength_ (a simplification of their ATP ranking)
- The _strength_ is an integer in the [0,100] range
- This number is provided to the counting assistant through the command line (default is 50)

## How to use this software?

To compile the source code into a turn-key _Java ARchive_ (JAR):

```
mosser@azrael 2aa4-tennis % mvn package  
```

To run the counting assistant:

```
mosser@azrael 2aa4-tennis % java -jar target/tennis.jar -p1 75 -p2 30
** Starting Tennis Counter Assistant
**** Reading Command-Line Arguments
****** P1's Strength is 75/100
****** P2's Strength is 30/100
**** Starting game
** TODO...
** Closing Tennis Counter Assistant
```

## Usage in 2AA4 @McMaster

- To look at the code used by your TA during tutorial #01, switch to the
  [`tutorial`](https://github.com/ace-lectures/2aa4-tennis/tree/tutorial) branch:
  - `git checkout tutorial`
- If you want to go through the step-by-step demo done during lecture #04, look at the [`dojo`](./dojo) directory.
  - Each step of the demo is available through a dedicated tag:
      - Initial conditions: `git checkout demo_step_0`
      - Walking skeleton `git checkout demo_step_01`
      - Minimal & viable product: `git checkout demo_step_02`
      - Second refactor: `git checkout demo_step_03`
- To look at the solution designed during Lecture #04 (_Case Study: The Tennis Counting_), switch
  to the [`solution`](https://github.com/ace-lectures/2aa4-tennis/tree/solution) branch:
  - `git checkout solution`
